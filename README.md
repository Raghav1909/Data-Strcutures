## Programs on Stacks

### Program 1

1. Write a C program to construct a stack and to perform the following operations:<br/>
i) Push <br/>
ii) Pop <br/>
iii) Display<br/>
The program should print appropriate message for stack overflow, stack underflow & stack empty.<br/> 

Refer [Program 1](Program1.c)

### Program 2

2. Write a C program to convert and print a given valid parenthesized infix arithmetic
expression to prefix expression. The expression consists of single character operands
and binary operators + (Plus), - (Minus), * (Multiply), / (Divide). <br/>

  Refer [Program 2](Program.c)

### Program 3

3. Write a C program to evaluate a valid prefix expression using stack. Assume that the
prefix expression is read as single line consisting of non-negative single digit operands
and binary arithmetic operations.

### Program 4

4. Write a C program to check whether a given string is palindrome or not using stack.

## Programs on Recursion

### Program 5

5. Write a recursive C program for
i) To find larger of ‘n’ elements in an array
ii) To multiply two natural numbers
iii) Solving the Towers of Hanoi Problem

## Programs on Queues

### Program 6

6. Write a C program to simulate the working of a queues using an array provide the
following operation
i) Insert ii) Delete iii) Display

### Program 7

7. Write a C program to simulate the working of a circular queues with items as strings.
Provide the following operations
i) Insert ii) Delete iii) Display

### Program 8

8. Write a C program to simulate the working of Double Ended Queue of integers using
Structures. Provide the following operations
i) Insert from front/rear end ii) Delete from front/rear end iii) Display

### Program 9

9. Write a C program to implement priority queues using structures (Assume a maximum
of 3 queues).

## Programs on Linked List

### Program 10

10. Write a C program using dynamic variables and pointers, to construct a Singly Linked List consisting of the following information in each node: 
Employee id (integer), Employee name (character string) and Department (character string). The operation to be supported are:
a) The insertion operation
i) At the front end of the list 
ii) At the rear end of the list
iii) At any position in the list
b) Deleting a node based on employee id. If the specified node is not present in the
list an error message should be displayed. Both the options should be demonstrated.
c) Searching a node based on employee id and update node information. If the
specified node is not present in the list an error message should be displayed. Both
situations should be displayed.
d) Displaying all the nodes in the list

### Program 11

11. Write a C program to construct a Ordered Singly Linked List and perform the
following operations
i) Reverse a list ii) Concatenation of two lists

### Program 12

12. Write a C program to support the following operations on a Doubly Linked List where
each node has the information as an integer
i) Create a Doubly Linked List by adding each node at the front
ii) Insert a new node to the right of the specified node.
iii) To delete all nodes whose info is same as that of key item.
iv) Display the contents of the list

## Programs on Trees

### Program 13

13. Write a C program
i) To construct a BST of items (No Duplicates)
ii) To search an item in BST
iii) To display the elements of the tree using Inorder, preorder, & Postorder
traversal methods.
