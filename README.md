## Programs on Stacks

1. Write a C program to construct a stack and to perform the following operations:<br/>
i) Push <br/>
ii) Pop <br/>
iii) Display<br/>
The program should print appropriate message for stack overflow, stack underflow & stack empty.<br/> 

Refer [Program 1](Program1.c)

2. Write a C program to convert and print a given valid parenthesized infix arithmetic
expression to prefix expression. The expression consists of single character operands
and binary operators + (Plus), - (Minus), * (Multiply), / (Divide). <br/>

  Refer [Program 2](Program.c)


3. Write a C program to evaluate a valid prefix expression using stack. Assume that the
prefix expression is read as single line consisting of non-negative single digit operands
and binary arithmetic operations.

4. Write a C program to check whether a given string is palindrome or not using stack.

## Programs on Recursion
5. Write a recursive C program for
i) To find larger of ‘n’ elements in an array
ii) To multiply two natural numbers
iii) Solving the Towers of Hanoi Problem

## Programs on Queues
6. Write a C program to simulate the working of a queues using an array provide the
following operation
i) Insert ii) Delete iii) Display
7. Write a C program to simulate the working of a circular queues with items as strings.
Provide the following operations
i) Insert ii) Delete iii) Display
8. Write a C program to simulate the working of Double Ended Queue of integers using
Structures. Provide the following operations
i) Insert from front/rear end ii) Delete from front/rear end iii) Display
9. Write a C program to implement priority queues using structures (Assume a maximum
of 3 queues).
